This project demonstrates how to use IoT Face Recognition APIs using python script

## System requirements
- Python 3

## Packages requirements
- requests

## Run demo
- go to project directory (where the scripts are put)

    $ cd iot-face-demo

- run "python3 <demo_script> <your_key>"

    $ python3 Example02_FaceGroupAPI.py 0ThisIsMyKeyNotYours

## Note
- the IoT Face Recognition APIs could be called by using "Api-Key" for now. However, in the near future, "x-client-id" should be used instead. The URLs would be changed as well then.
