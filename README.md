# This project demonstrates how to use IoT Face Recognition APIs using python script

## prepare environment
- install python3
- install package "requests" by pip

## run demo program
- cd to project directory (where the scripts are put)
- run "python3 <demo_script> <your_key>"

    $ python3 Example02_FaceGroupAPI.py aabbccddeeffgghhiijj

# NOTE: 
- the IoT Face Recognition APIs could be called by using "Api-Key" for now. However, in the near future, "x-client-id" should be used instead. The URLs would be changed as well then.
